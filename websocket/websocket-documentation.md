# Websocket Documentation v0.1

## Calling functions

All comunications from and to the sever are done using json data (excluding exceptions and keepalive)
To call a function simply send a json object with the value command an the call handle

Parameters are defined as extra values in the same array

Furthermore it is expected that every request will include a sequence number, it is irelivant if its a number that counts up or is just randomly selected. This allows out of sequence communication so you can request multiple thinkgs at once. It is expected to be in the base of the json string with the name "seq"

To keep the connection alive send an empty packet every x secounds.

Example json: ``{"cmd": "checkTokenLogin","token": "TOKEN","seq": 100}`
